Notebooks/
This directory contains all the Jupyter notebooks used for analysis, EDA, and model training.

- **MachineLearningEDA+Modelling.ipynb**  
The problem is approached using machine learning, encompassing both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling. The objective is to forecast the Claim_amount. This is tackled as both a classification and a regression problem:

* **Classification**: All non-zero values are converted to 1, indicating that a claim has been made, while 0 indicates no claim.
* **Regression**: Predict the actual claim amount for the instances where claims are made.

- **LLM_fine_tuningipynb.ipynb**  
  The Modelling is also done using the LLM model FLANT-5 Model. The demo for this is created on HuggingFace.  
  The Dataset is prepared in a supervised way where the model is asked to actually claim amount for the instances where claims are made.

![Alt text](<images/image copy.png>)

* **Summary Statistics**:
![Alt text](<images/image copy 2.png>)
- The describe() function provides summary statistics for numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50th percentile), 75th percentile, and maximum values.
- Key statistics for numeric columns such as Annual_Income, Price_($), Phone, Amount_paid_for_insurance, and Claim_amount are provided.

* **Dublicate Rows** : There is No dublicate rows present in our dataset. 

* **Missing Values**:There is one missing value in the Customer_Name column.All other columns have no missing values.
![Alt text](<images/imagecopy.png>)

- So we decided to impute the missing values with the string value "Missing". Now we don't have any Missing Values in the Customer_Name column.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We further generate a complete and exhaustive report for the dataset using the following
    - Pandas profiling 
    - Autoviz
    - Sweet

**Observations Average Claim Amount and Insurance Paid**:

 ![Alt text](<images/image copy 51.png>)
 ![Alt text](<images/image copy 52.png>)

**Weekly Trends**: There seems to be some fluctuation in both average claim amount and insurance paid throughout the weeks, but there is no clear consistent pattern or trend. Some weeks have higher averages, while others have lower, suggesting that claim amounts and insurance premiums might be influenced by factors other than the week of the year.

**Seasonal Trends**: The average claim amount and insurance paid show some seasonal variation throughout the year. There are periods with higher averages, particularly around the beginning and middle of the year, and periods with lower averages. This could be due to various factors such as weather conditions, holidays, or changes in driving patterns throughout the year.

**Relationship between Claim Amount and Insurance Paid**: The two lines in the plots generally follow a similar pattern, indicating a positive correlation between the average claim amount and the average amount paid for insurance. This suggests that higher insurance premiums might be associated with a higher risk of claims or more expensive claims.


* **Correlation Analysis**:

![Alt text](<images/image copy 6.png>)

 - **Amount_paid_for_insurance and Price_($)**: There is a high overall correlation between the amount paid for insurance and the price of the vehicles. This correlation suggests that as the price of the vehicle increases, the amount paid for insurance also tends to increase.

- **Dealer_Name and Dealer_No**: There is a high overall correlation between dealer names and dealer numbers. This correlation indicates a strong association between specific dealerships and their unique identification numbers.

- **Engine and Transmission**: There is a high overall correlation between the type of engine and transmission used in vehicles. This correlation suggests that certain engine types are commonly paired with specific transmission types.


The highly correlated features contains the redundant information. So we decided to keep only the one features and remove the redundant features. 
Observations: 
    - Highly correlated features can make it challenging to interpret the importance of individual features. Feature importance becomes ambiguous when two or more features convey similar information.
    - Models trained on datasets with highly correlated features may perform well on the training data but struggle to generalize to new, unseen data.
    - Correlated features can lead to a phenomenon known as the “curse of dimensionality,” where the model’s performance degrades as the number of features increases.

   - Interpretable models are essential for understanding the factors influencing predictions. Removing correlated features aids in clearer interpretation and better decision-making.
   - Removing correlated features helps improve a model’s ability to generalize to new data, reducing the risk of overfitting and making the model more robust.
   - Removing redundant features can lead to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting and perform better on unseen data.


* **Car_id**: Each car ID in the dataset is unique, indicating that there are no duplicate entries for vehicle identifiers.
The "Car_id" column should be removed because it contains unique values for each entry in the dataset. Since each car ID is unique, this column essentially serves as an identifier or key for individual records and does not provide any meaningful information for analysis or modeling purposes. Including such a column in predictive modeling can introduce noise and computational overhead without contributing to the model's predictive power. Therefore, removing the "Car_id" column simplifies the dataset and improves the efficiency and interpretability of machine learning algorithms.

* **Date Feature Extraction**: Converte the 'Date' column to a datetime data type using the pd.to_datetime() function. This conversion ensures that the 'Date' column is recognized and treated as datetime objects, enabling subsequent manipulation and extraction of temporal information.
  
Initial Dataset Information:
After the conversion, we verify the data types and information of the DataFrame using the df.info() function. This step is crucial to confirm the successful conversion of the 'Date' column to datetime format and to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
![Alt text](<images/image copy 4.png>)

Feature Extraction:

- **Year Extraction**: Extract the year component from the 'Date' column using the .dt.year accessor and create a new column named 'Year'. This allows us to analyze trends and patterns at a yearly granularity.
- **Month Extraction**: Similarly, we extract the month component from the 'Date' column using the .dt.strftime('%b') method, which formats the month as abbreviated names (e.g., Jan, Feb) and create a new column named 'Month'. This facilitates analysis based on monthly variations and seasonality.
- **Day Extraction**: Additionally, we extract the day component from the 'Date' column using the .dt.day accessor and create a new column named 'Day'. This captures the day of the month for each record, enabling insights related to cyclic behaviors or specific temporal events within a month.



**Customer Names**: 

  ![Alt text](<images/image copy 7.png>)
- We are using word cloud or text visualization composed of various names.Some key observations:
- The central and largest names in the image are Emma, Lucas, Thomas, and Nathan, suggesting these may be popular or common names represented in this visualization.
- The names are predominantly of English or Western origin, with a few names like Alexis, Antoine, and Nicolas that could be of French or European origin.
- The names seem to be a mix of both male and female names, indicating a representation of both genders.
![Alt text](<images/image copy 8.png>)

Gender:

  ![Alt text](<images/image copy 5.png>)
- The image presents gender distribution data visualized through a pie chart and a bar chart.
- The pie chart shows that 78.6% i.e (18798) of the individuals in the dataset are male, while 21.4% (5108) are female.
- The bar chart further reinforces this observation by displaying the count or frequency of males and females in the dataset. The blue bar representing males is significantly higher than the bar for females, indicating a higher number of males in the dataset.


Transmission : 

  ![Alt text](<images/plot1.png>)
- The histogram shows the counts or frequencies of two transmission types: "Auto" and "Manual".
- The "Auto" transmission type has a significantly higher count (52.99%) compared to the "Manual" transmission type (47.41%).
- This suggests that automatic transmissions are more common or prevalent in the dataset represented by this histogram.

Engine: 

  ![Alt text](<images/plot2.png>)
- The histogram displays the counts or frequencies of two engine types.
- One engine type has a count of 52.99%, while the other has a count of 47.41%.
- This similarity in distribution suggests a potential correlation or relationship between the transmission type and engine type in the dataset.

Dealer_Name: 

  ![Alt text](<images/plot3.png>)
- This histogram shows the counts or frequencies of different dealer names.
- The dealer names are displayed along the x-axis, but they are not explicitly mentioned.
- The histogram reveals a wide range of counts or frequencies for different dealer names, with one dealer having a significantly higher count (51.49%) than the others.
- Most dealer names have relatively low counts, typically less than 5%.
- This histogram provides insights into the distribution of data across different dealers or dealerships in the dataset.

Company:

  ![Alt text](<images/plot4.png>)
- The histogram displays the counts or frequencies of different companies or manufacturers.
- The companies or manufacturers are listed along the x-axis.
- The company with the highest count is "Chevrolet" (61%), indicating that it is the most prevalent or dominant company in the dataset.
- Other companies like "Dodge" (9.99%), "Ford" (7.75%), and "Volkswagen" (5.58%) have relatively lower but notable counts.
- Several companies have very low counts, suggesting they have a smaller presence or representation in the dataset.
- This histogram provides insights into the distribution of data across different vehicle manufacturers or companies. 


Engine 

  ![Alt text](<images/plot5.png>)
- There are two engine types represented in the data: "Double A, Overhead Camshaft" and "Overhead Camshaft".
- The "Double A, Overhead Camshaft" engine type has a significantly higher count, represented by the taller blue bar, with 52.59% of the total counts.
- The "Overhead Camshaft" engine type has a lower count, represented by the shorter green bar, with 47.41% of the total counts.
- While the "Double A, Overhead Camshaft" engine type has a higher count, the difference between the two engine types is not extremely large, indicating that both types are relatively common in the data set.

Phone 

 ![Alt text](<images/image copy 50.png>)
Each Phone No in the dataset is unique, indicating that there are 99.9% distinct values in the dataset. This dataset can be removed as it contains almost unique values for each entry in the dataset.

**Observations Total claim amount over the months**

 ![Alt text](<images/plot6.png>)

- The highest claim amounts occur during the later months of the year, peaking in November and December of both 2022 and 2023.
- There's a consistent dip in claim amounts during the early months of the year, particularly in January and February.
- The months of May, August, September, and October show relatively high claim amounts compared to the early months of the year.
- This suggests a cyclical pattern where claims increase towards the end of the year and decrease at the beginning. This could be due to various factors such as weather conditions, holiday travel, or other seasonal trends that influence driving patterns and accident rates.

**Observations w.r.t to Normal Distribution**
![Alt text](<images/image copy 41.png>)

**Observations w.r.t to Average Claim Amount**

![Alt text](<images/image copy 42.png>)

* Pars Auto Sales has the highest average claim amount, while Motor Vehicle Branch Office has the lowest.
* Cadillac has the highest average claim amount , while Hyundai has the lowest.
* The average claim amount is slightly Red Color followed by Black & Pale White.ù
* Sedans have the highest average claim amount, while SUVs have the lowest.
* Tukums has the highest average claim amount, while Riga has the lowest.
* The Catera model has the highest average claim amount  while the Avalon and Mirage models have the lowest.
* Cars with Overhead Camshaft engines have a slightly higher average claim amount  than those with Double Overhead Camshaft engines.
* Cars with manual transmissions have a slightly higher average claim amount than those with automatic transmissions.
* The average claim amount is relatively stable across years, with a slight increase in 2023.
* The average claim amount is slightly higher in the summer and fall months.
* The average claim amount is slightly higher for females compared to males.

**Observations for Insurancers**

* **Risk Assessment**: The observed patterns can be valuable for risk assessment and pricing. Insurers could use this information to adjust premiums based on the dealer, company, city, car price, engine type, body style etc.

* **Fraud Detection**: Identifying cities or dealers with unusually high average claim amounts could help in detecting potential fraud or areas where claims handling processes need improvement.

**Observations w.r.t to Model**

![Alt text](<images/image copy 43.png>)
- The central and largest names in the image are Coupe, Ram, grand, and Diamente, suggesting these may be popular or common names represented in this visualization.


**Observations w.r.t to City**

![Alt text](<images/image copy 10.png>)

- Riga has the highest count for both "Auto" and "Manual" transmissions across all cities.
- Daugavpils and Tukums have relatively lower counts compared to other cities for both transmission types.

- Other cities like Liepaja, Jelgava, and Ventspils also have significant counts for certain companies.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 13.png>)

- There is a large number of individual dealer names represented across the cities.
- The distribution pattern is similar across cities, with a mix of higher and lower counts for different dealer names.
- Riga, being the largest city, tends to have higher counts for most dealer names compared to other cities.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 14.png>)

- This bar chart shows the distribution of dealer names across different cities.
- The cities included are Riga, Liepaja, Jelgava, Ventspils, Daugavpils, and Tukums.

- The male population is significantly larger than the female population in all cities.
- Riga has the highest overall population for both genders, followed by Liepaja and Jelgava.
- The chart allows for easy comparison of gender ratios between different cities.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 16.png>)

- These stacked bar charts show the distribution of different body styles (SUV, Passenger, Hatchback, Hatchback, and Sedan) across the cities.
- The SUV and Passenger body styles appear to be the most prevalent in all cities.
- Riga and Liepaja have the highest counts for each body style compared to other cities.
- The charts provide insights into the popularity of various vehicle body styles in different regions.

* **Claim_amount**: A significant portion of claim amounts (90.0%) in the dataset are zeros. This observation suggests that the majority of insurance claims associated with the vehicles in the dataset do not involve monetary compensation.

After this observation we decided to remove the below columns. 
* Car_id 
* Customer_Name
* Amount_paid_for_insurance
* Dealer_No
* Transmission
* Customer_Name
* Phone


Now let's look at the Numerical Variables below 

![Alt text](<images/image copy 9.png>)

* **Annual Income Chart**:The distribution of annual income displays a right-skewed or positively skewed pattern. This means that the majority of the data points are concentrated on the lower end of the income range, with a long tail extending towards the higher income values. This type of distribution is common for income data, as a relatively small proportion of the population tends to have very high incomes, while the majority fall within lower to middle-income ranges. The sharp peak near zero suggests a significant number of individuals with little to no income.

* **Price Chart**:The price distribution appears to be bimodal or potentially multimodal, indicating the presence of two or more distinct peaks or modes. This pattern could arise in scenarios where there are different tiers or categories of pricing for products or services. For example, one peak might represent lower-priced items, while another peak corresponds to higher-end or premium offerings. The multiple peaks suggest that prices tend to cluster around certain values, rather than being evenly distributed across the range.

* **Claim Amount Chart**:The claim amount distribution exhibits a strong right-skewed or positive skew. The distribution is heavily concentrated towards lower claim amounts, with a steep peak near zero, implying that a large number of claims are relatively small in value. However, the long tail extending towards higher claim amounts indicates the presence of a smaller number of claims with significantly larger monetary values. This pattern is typical in insurance or healthcare contexts, where most claims are for routine or minor expenses, while a few claims involve substantial costs, potentially due to major medical events or accidents.


**Observations w.r.t to Claim Amount**
![Alt text](<images/image copy 17.png>)

Based on the multi-panel visualization, I can make the following observations related to financial and risk forecasting for car insurance claims:

- More claims come from customers with lower incomes, so insurers may need to adjust pricing or risk models for this customer segment.
- Most claims are for smaller amounts around $1,500, but there are also some larger claims up to $7,500 or more. Insurers need to plan for both frequent small claims and occasional large claims.
- There is a pattern of more claims happening around the middle of the year, likely due to factors like more driving or weather impacts. Understanding these seasonal patterns can help predict claim volumes.So the maximum peaks or highest volumes of claims occur around the middle of the year, likely during the summer months of June, July and August.
- The distribution of claims across different vehicle prices/policy types provides insights into potential losses for each pricing tier.
- Sudden spikes in daily claims, or outlier events with many claims at once, indicate a need to account for volatility and extreme scenarios when calculating risks and financial reserves.

In simple terms, this data can help insurers better estimate claim costs, set appropriate pricing, and have sufficient funds reserved to cover claims while accounting for patterns, different customer groups, and potential volatility in the claims process.

**Outliers in Annual_income , Claim_amount & Price**
Based on the pie charts provided, I can make the following observations:

![Alt text](<images/image copy 18.png>)

**After Removing Outliers using Cappping**

![Alt text](<images/image copy 40.png>)


![Alt text](<images/image copy 45.png>)


**Observations based Total percentage of Amount claimed**

![Alt text](<images/image copy 20.png>)

- This chart shows the total percentage of claims amount by city. Tukums has claimed the highest amount by a percentage at 17.8%, followed by Liepaja at 17%, Daugavpils at 16.7% ,entspils at 16.7%&  Riga at 15.2%.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 21.png>)

- This chart displays the Total percentage of claims by car company. The top companies with the claimed of highest amount by a percentages are Chevrolet (7.3%) ,Dodge (6.9%) ,Ford (6.3%) Oldsmobile (5.8%),Cadillac (4.4%) ,Mercedes-B (5.1%), Mitsubishi (5%), Mercury (4%).



![Alt text](<images/image copy 22.png>)

- This chart illustrates the Total percentage of claims by car color. Pale White accounts for the highest percentage at 45.4% for Pale White, followed by Black at 32.3%, and Red at 22.3%.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 23.png>)

- This chart presents the Total percentage of claims by car body style. SUVs have the highest percentage at 25.3% for Hatchback, followed by SUV at 24.5%,  Sedans at 20.1%,Passenger vehicles at 16.9%, and Hardtops at 13.2%.

![Alt text](<images/image copy 24.png>)

- This chart shows the Total percentage of claims by month. The month with the highest percentage is December (14.8%), followed by November (13.9%), April (14%), October (10%), and September (9%).

![Alt text](<images/image copy 25.png>)

- This chart shows the Total percentage of claims by Year. The year with the claimed the highest amount by percentage is 2023 (55.5%), followed by 2022 (44.5%).


![Alt text](<images/image copy 46.png>)

- This chart shows the Total percentage of claims by Gender. The Male have claimed the highest amount by percentage is Male (78.5%%), followed by female (21.5%).

![Alt text](<images/image copy 47.png>)

- This chart shows the Total percentage of claims by Engine. The Engine with the claimed the highest amount by percentage is Double A (51.8%), followed by Overheard camshaft (48.2%).


![Alt text](<images/image copy 48.png>)
- **Dominance of Low-Income Category**: The most striking observation is the overwhelming dominance of the 13,500 annual income category, accounting for 64.3% of the total claim amount. This indicates that policyholders in this income bracket are responsible for the majority of claim payouts, despite potentially having a lower number of policies compared to higher-income groups.
- **Long Tail of High-Income Categories**: There is a long tail of higher-income categories, each representing a small percentage of the total claim amount (around 1.4-1.8% each). While individually small, these categories collectively contribute a significant portion of the total claim amount.

- **Outlier**: The 3,229,750 annual income category stands out as an outlier, with a notably larger share of the total claim amount (4.7%) compared to other high-income categories. This could be due to a few very large claims within this group or a higher average claim amount for this income level.

- **Potential for Risk Segmentation**: The chart suggests a clear pattern of increasing claim amount with higher income levels (excluding the outlier). This could be attributed to factors such as higher-value vehicles, more comprehensive coverage, or different driving patterns among higher-income policyholders.


![Alt text](<images/image copy 49.png>)
- **Dominance of Mid-Range Prices**: The pie chart reveals that cars priced between $19,000 and $31,000 account for the largest share of the total claim amount. This suggests that mid-range priced cars are more likely to be involved in accidents or have higher claim amounts compared to other price ranges.
- **Even Distribution of Lower and Higher Prices**: Cars priced below $19,000 and above $31,000 have a relatively even distribution in terms of their contribution to the total claim amount. Each price category within these ranges accounts for approximately 3.5-6.9% of the total claim amount.
- **Outlier**: The car priced at $75,500 stands out as an outlier, contributing a significantly smaller proportion (4.5%) to the total claim amount compared to other high-priced cars. This could be due to a lower number of insured cars in this price range or a lower claim frequency for such expensive vehicles.
- **Potential for Risk Segmentation**: The chart suggests a potential relationship between car price and claim amount, with mid-range priced cars having a higher risk profile. However, this relationship is not strictly linear, as both lower and higher-priced cars also contribute significantly to the total claim amount.



**Observations based TimeSeries Claim_amount , Price & Annual Income**


Given that the data is related to car insurance, with the price representing the car's price, annual income representing the customer's annual income, and claim amount representing the claims made by the customer, the following observations can be made from a financial and risk analysis perspective:

Claim Amount:

- The highly volatile and fluctuating nature of claim amounts suggests that there are periods with higher risk of claims, possibly due to factors like accidents, natural disasters, or other events leading to increased claims activity.
Insurance companies need to maintain adequate reserves and implement effective risk management strategies to handle these claim spikes and ensure financial stability.
Analysis of claim patterns and underlying causes can help identify potential risk factors and develop targeted risk mitigation strategies.

Price:

- The volatility in car prices can impact the insurance premium calculations and the potential claim payouts for insured vehicles.
Highly fluctuating car prices may indicate market uncertainties or changing demand and supply dynamics, which can affect the insurer's risk exposure and profitability.
Insurers may need to adjust their pricing models and underwriting criteria to account for the volatility in car prices and associated risks.

Annual Income:

![Alt text](<images/image copy 30.png>)
- The relatively stable pattern of annual income data suggests a more predictable cash flow for customers, which can positively impact their ability to pay insurance premiums consistently.
However, fluctuations in annual income can affect customers' purchasing power and their willingness or ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage.
Insurers may consider offering flexible payment options or adjusting premiums based on income levels to ensure affordability and maintain customer retention.


correlation Matrix 
![Alt text](<images/image copy 36.png>)

Strong Positive Correlations:

- Amount Paid for Insurance vs. Claim Amount: The strongest positive correlation is between the amount paid for insurance and the claim amount. This is intuitive – more expensive policies generally cover higher potential payouts.
- Car Price vs. Claim Amount: There's a moderately strong positive correlation here, suggesting that more expensive cars tend to have higher claim amounts when accidents occur. This could be due to higher repair costs or a tendency for owners of expensive cars to file claims more often.
Year vs. Month & Day: The correlation between year and month, and year and day, is expected due to the sequential nature of dates.

Moderate Positive Correlations:

- Annual Income vs. Amount Paid for Insurance: Higher earners tend to purchase more comprehensive (and thus more expensive) insurance policies.
- Annual Income vs. Car Price: Higher earners are more likely to own more expensive cars.

Weak Positive Correlations:

- Engine Type (Double Overhead Camshaft) vs. Claim Amount and Price: Cars with this engine type seem slightly more likely to have higher claim amounts and are often more expensive. This could be due to the types of cars (performance, luxury) that often have this engine.

Weak Negative Correlations:

- Annual Income vs. Claim Frequency: There's a slight tendency for those with higher incomes to have fewer claims. This could be due to safer driving habits, newer cars, or living in areas with lower accident rates.

Notable Absence of Correlation:

- Gender and Most Variables: Gender doesn't seem to correlate strongly with any other factors, including claim amounts or insurance costs. This suggests that gender might not be a significant factor in determining insurance premiums in this dataset.


The features after converting the categorical features into numerical features
![Alt text](<images/image copy 31.png>)

Numerical Variables:

- Annual_Income: The distribution is heavily right-skewed, indicating that most policyholders have lower annual incomes, with a few outliers having very high incomes. This suggests a potential concentration of risk within the lower-income segment.

- Price ($): The distribution is also right-skewed, suggesting that most insured cars are relatively inexpensive, with fewer expensive cars in the dataset. This could influence the distribution of claim amounts.

- Claim_amount: The distribution is heavily right-skewed with a long tail, indicating that most claims are small, but there are a few very large claims. This is a typical pattern in insurance data.

- Day: The distribution is relatively uniform, suggesting that the day of the month doesn't have a significant impact on claim frequency or severity.

Categorical Variables:

- Gender: There are two categories (likely male and female), with one category having slightly more occurrences. This could be investigated further to see if there are differences in claim behavior between genders.

- Company: There are several companies, with varying frequencies. Some companies have a much higher number of policies than others, which could be due to differences in market share or target demographics.

- Month: There seems to be some seasonality in the data, with certain months having more claims than others. This could be due to factors like weather conditions or holiday travel patterns.

- City: There are a few cities, with varying frequencies. Some cities might have higher accident rates or more expensive repairs, leading to differences in claim frequency or severity.

- Model: There are many different car models, with most models having a relatively low frequency. This indicates a diverse portfolio of insured vehicles.

- Engine: There are two engine types (likely gasoline and diesel), with one type being more common. This could be investigated to see if engine type is associated with claim risk.

- Color: There are a few car colors, with some being more frequent than others. It's unlikely that color has a direct impact on claim risk, but it could be correlated with other factors like car type or driver demographics.

- Body_Style: There are a few body styles, with varying frequencies. Some body styles might be more prone to accidents or have higher repair costs, leading to differences in claim amounts.



**Ideal Customer Profiles Information**

- Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford are the top three companies in terms of total claim amounts, indicating a higher frequency or severity of claims for these brands compared to others. This could be due to various factors, such as the popularity of these brands, the types of vehicles they manufacture, or the demographics of their customer base.

- The LS400, Eldorado, and Jetta are the top three car models with the highest total claim amounts. This suggests that these models might be more prone to accidents, have higher repair costs, or are more likely to be driven by individuals with a higher risk profile.

- Gender: Male customers are more profitable due to their higher representation.
- Location: Customers from Liepaja, Riga, and Jelgava are the most profitable.
- Car Type: Customers who own SUVs or Hatchbacks are the most profitable.

- The average claim amount and the average amount paid for insurance vary significantly across car companies and models. This highlights the importance of considering both factors when assessing risk and setting premiums. For example, while Cadillac has a relatively low total claim amount, its average claim amount is the highest among the top 10 companies, indicating that claims for Cadillac vehicles tend to be more expensive.

- The distribution of claim amounts and insurance premiums across different car companies and models can be valuable for risk assessment and pricing. Insurers can use this information to develop more accurate risk models and tailor premiums to specific car brands and models. For instance, premiums for Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford vehicles might be adjusted upwards due to their higher claim amounts, while premiums for less frequently claimed models like the Avalon or Mirage could potentially be lowered.

- Income-Based Risk Models: The dominance of the 13,500 annual income category in claim amounts, coupled with the increasing trend of claim amounts with higher income levels (excluding the outlier), suggests a strong correlation between income and risk. This information can be used to develop income-based risk models, allowing insurers to adjust premiums or coverage options accordingly. For instance, higher premiums might be considered for higher-income groups due to their higher claim amounts, while lower-income groups could be offered more affordable options with potentially lower coverage limits.

- Car Price and Risk: The concentration of claim amounts in the mid-range car price segment indicates a higher risk profile for these vehicles. This could be attributed to factors such as the prevalence of these cars on the road, their usage patterns, or their vulnerability to damage. Insurers can utilize this information to refine risk assessment and pricing models, potentially adjusting premiums based on car price, particularly for mid-range priced vehicles.
